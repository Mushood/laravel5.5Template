## Custom Template
This is a custom template that I use to kickstart a new project. Included are designs, composer packages and npm packages that I use frequently.

*** Composer Packages used ***
- Sluggable: https://github.com/cviebrock/eloquent-sluggable
- Role & Permissions: https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission
- Image: http://image.intervention.io/

*** NPM packages ***
- SweetAlert: https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-sweetalert2
- vue2editor: https://github.com/davidroyer/vue2-editor
- slider: https://github.com/staskjs/vue-slick

*** Admin designs ***
- Laravel Backpack: https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/Base :: included skins as well, to change as required.
- An initial layout is set using the navbar from bootstrap 3.3.7 required in app.scss

To change skin: 
- Change skin in layout.blade.php
- Change copy command in webpack.mix.js
- command: rpm run dev/watch/production

*** Front end framework ***
- Vue.js is used as a front-end framework to add reactivity to the project. The required packages are included
- A custom file uploader is used in the project. However, it is in the components folder instead of the node_modules folder since I often find myself modifying its functionality



## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
